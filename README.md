To use the bookmarklet for checking if interactive items are at least 24px in size, follow these simple steps:

Hover your mouse over an item you want to test on a webpage.
If you've activated the bookmarklet, observe the cursor's shape. This tool is designed to change the cursor's appearance, but keep in mind, the specific code provided doesn't automatically measure or highlight items based on their size.
For checking sizes, you might need additional tools or browser developer tools to inspect element sizes directly.
