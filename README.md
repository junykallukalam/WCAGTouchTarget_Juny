# 24px Checker Bookmarklet Guide

To use the "24px Checker" bookmarklet for assessing WCAG 2.2 target size compliance, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Copy the JavaScript Code

First, you need to copy the JavaScript code from the file named `touchtarget.js`. This code enables the bookmarklet to change the cursor's appearance, aiding in the visual assessment of interactive elements on webpages.

## Step 2: Create a Bookmark

- Open your web browser and navigate to the bookmarks bar.
- Right-click on the bookmarks bar and select "Add Page" or "New Bookmark," depending on your browser.
- In the Name field, enter `24px Checker` to label your bookmark.
- In the URL or Location field, paste the JavaScript code you copied from `TouchTarget.js`.

## Step 3: Use the Bookmarklet

- Go to a website you want to check.
- Click on the `24px Checker` bookmark in your bookmarks bar. Your cursor will change to indicate the bookmarklet is active.

## Step 4: Toggle the Tool On and Off

- Press the "Escape" key to deactivate the bookmarklet and return your cursor to its normal state.

Remember, this tool is for quick visual assessments and does not replace thorough accessibility testing.
